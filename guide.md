## Implementation Priority
### Phase 1: Core Modifications
âœ… Replace CrossEntropy with BCEWithLogitsLoss
âœ… Modify CAM extraction for multi-hot labels
âœ… Implement multi-label attention diversity loss
### Phase 2: Advanced Features
âœ… Per-class gating mechanism
âœ… Multi-label evaluation metrics
âœ… Label-aware expert selection
### Phase 3: Research Extensions
ðŸ”¬ Hierarchical attention mechanisms
ðŸ”¬ Dynamic expert architectures
ðŸ”¬ Label correlation modeling

## Expected Benefits
Enhanced Diversity: Experts specialize in different label combinations
Better Generalization: Improved handling of unseen label combinations (crucial for open-set multi-label)
Semantic Understanding: Class-specific gating captures label relationships
Scalability: Architecture scales to large label vocabularies
This modification transforms MEDAF from a single-label to a sophisticated multi-label learning framework while preserving its core strengths: diverse expert representations and adaptive fusion. The attention diversity mechanism becomes even more powerful in multi-label settings by encouraging experts to focus on different semantic aspects across multiple co-occurring labels.
