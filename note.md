5. **`divAttn` (Attention Diversity Loss)**:
   - **Purpose**: Encourages different experts to focus on different spatial regions
   - **What it measures**: How diverse the attention patterns are across experts
   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0+ (lower is better - we want diverse attention)
   - **Your values**: Started at 0.3237, improved to 0.1656

6. **`total` (Total Weighted Loss)**:
   - **Purpose**: Combined loss with weights: `0.7 * (b1+b2+b3) + 1.0 * gate + 0.01 * divAttn`
   - **What it measures**: Overall training objective
   - **Your values**: Started at 2.2748, improved to 0.7424

### **Accuracy Components:**

1. **`acc1` (Expert 1 Accuracy)**:
   - **Purpose**: Subset accuracy (exact match) for Expert Branch 1
   - **What it measures**: Percentage of samples where ALL predicted labels match ground truth
   - **Range**: 0-100% (higher is better)
   - **Your values**: Started at 0%, improved to 58.6%

2. **`acc2` (Expert 2 Accuracy)**:
   - **Purpose**: Subset accuracy for Expert Branch 2
   - **Your values**: Started at 0%, improved to 58.7%

3. **`acc3` (Expert 3 Accuracy)**:
   - **Purpose**: Subset accuracy for Expert Branch 3
   - **Your values**: Started at 0%, improved to 58.7%

4. **`accGate` (Gating Network Accuracy)**:
   - **Purpose**: Subset accuracy for the fused predictions
   - **Your values**: Started at 0%, improved to 58.6%

Now let me add detailed comments to your training function to make it easier to understand:

## **Summary: Understanding Your MEDAF Training Statistics**

I've added comprehensive comments to your training functions and explained each statistic. Here's a quick reference guide:

### **üîç What Each Statistic Means:**

| **Statistic** | **Full Name** | **Purpose** | **Good Values** |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **`b1`** | Branch 1 Loss | Expert 1's classification loss | Lower is better (0.2-0.4) |
| **`b2`** | Branch 2 Loss | Expert 2's classification loss | Lower is better (0.2-0.4) |
| **`b3`** | Branch 3 Loss | Expert 3's classification loss | Lower is better (0.2-0.4) |
| **`gate`** | Gating Loss | Fused prediction loss | Lower is better (0.2-0.4) |
| **`divAttn`** | Diversity Loss | Attention pattern diversity | Lower is better (0.1-0.3) |
| **`total`** | Total Loss | Weighted combination | Lower is better (0.7-1.0) |
| **`acc1`** | Expert 1 Accuracy | Exact label match % | Higher is better (50-70%) |
| **`acc2`** | Expert 2 Accuracy | Exact label match % | Higher is better (50-70%) |
| **`acc3`** | Expert 3 Accuracy | Exact label match % | Higher is better (50-70%) |
| **`accGate`** | Gating Accuracy | Fused prediction accuracy | Higher is better (50-70%) |

### **üìä Your Training Progress Analysis:**

**‚úÖ Good Progress Indicators:**

- All losses are decreasing (b1: 0.88‚Üí0.24, b2: 0.73‚Üí0.24, etc.)
- Accuracies are improving (0%‚Üí58%+ across all experts)
- Diversity loss is decreasing (0.32‚Üí0.17), showing experts are learning different attention patterns
- Total loss reduced from 2.27 to 0.74 (67% improvement)

**üéØ What This Means:**

- Your 3 expert branches are learning to predict diseases independently
- The gating network is learning to combine expert predictions effectively
- Experts are developing diverse attention patterns (good for robustness)
- The model is successfully learning multi-label disease classification

The training is progressing well! The model is learning to identify multiple diseases simultaneously in chest X-rays, with each expert focusing on different aspects of the images.
